### Inventory Manager Requirements
- **TUnitInventoryManager**: Manage all items carried by a single unit. Fixed slots: Armour | Weapon | Equipment x4. No interface, only manages what can be moved where between inventory slots and also adding/removing from outside.
- **TCraftInventoryManager**: Manage all items carried by a single craft. Fixed slots: 3 Weapons and 2 Equipment, works same as TUnitInventoryManager but for craft.
- **TBaseInventoryManager**: Manage all items stored at base level. Allows storage and management of all items (for crafts, units and others). No slots, just a dict of items (item name | volume). Manages different capacities like space for items, units, crafts, prisoners etc.

### UI Widget Requirements
- **TUnitInventorySlot**: Visual widget for unit to handle single inventory slot. Contains TItem and displays its sprite. For drag and drop. Always contains single TItem.

- **TCraftPersonelSlot**: Visual widget like TUnitInventorySlot but for units assigned to craft. Always contains single TUnit.
- **TBaseFacilitySlot**: Visual widget like TUnitInventorySlot but for facilities assigned to base. Always contains single TFacility.
- **TUnitSlot**: Visual widget for craft to handle single unit slot (personnel assigned to craft). Contains TUnit and displays its sprite. For drag and drop. Always contains single TUnit.

### List Widget Requirements
- **TUnitListWidget**: Visual widget to handle list of units inside a base. List widget with combo box to control units category. No drag and drop needed.

## Critical Missing Components

All critical components are now implemented. The inventory system meets the requirements outlined in the plan and previous reports.

## Next Steps Recommendations

1. Continue to ensure proper integration between all components
2. Add/extend unit tests for the inventory system
3. Document the API for all components for easier future maintenance
4. Standardize the naming scheme across all components
5. Ensure proper error handling in inventory operations

## Inventory Manager Standardization (2025 Update)

All inventory manager classes have been standardized to use a unified, minimal interface for template handling and serialization:

- **TUnitInventoryManager** and **TCraftInventoryManager**:
  - Only one template in memory per manager (no naming, no management system).
  - Simple `save_template()` and `load_template()` methods for saving/loading the current configuration.
  - All redundant or duplicated template code has been removed.
  - Slot/hardpoint logic and stat modification are preserved and consistent.

- **TBaseInventoryManager** (TBaseInventory):
  - Now supports `save_template()` and `load_template()` for the entire base state (items, units, crafts, captures).
  - Uses the same simple, unified interface as the other managers.

**Benefits:**
- No duplicated code for template management.
- Consistent interface for all inventory managers.
- Easier maintenance and future extension.

**Status Table Update:**
| Component Type         | Standardized | Template Save/Load | Duplicates Removed |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| TUnitInventoryManager | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅                |
| TCraftInventoryManager| ✅          | ✅                 | ✅                |
| TBaseInventoryManager | ✅          | ✅                 | ✅                |

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure all UI and integration code uses the new standardized interface.
- Add/extend unit tests for template save/load on all managers.
- Continue to avoid code duplication in future features.
