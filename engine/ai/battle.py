battle.py - AI logic for enemy unit behavior during tactical battles.
Defines the TBattleAI class responsible for enemy decision-making in combat.

This module provides the TBattleAI class, which encapsulates the tactical decision-making
process for enemy units during battles. It is responsible for selecting targets, deciding
movements, and executing actions for all AI-controlled units each turn.
