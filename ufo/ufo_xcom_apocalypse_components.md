## Lore & Story Overview
It is the late 21st century. After previous alien wars, Earth is devastated and most of humanity lives in the sprawling city of Mega-Primus, a self-contained metropolis. X-COM is reformed to defend the city from a new, mysterious alien incursion. These aliens use dimensional gates to invade, threatening the fragile peace and stability of Mega-Primus. The player must manage X-COM’s operations, defend the city, investigate the origins of the new threat, and ultimately take the fight to the alien dimension to save humanity once again.
